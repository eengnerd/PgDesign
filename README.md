# PgDesign
PgDesign is a front end design tool for PostGreSQL
Anyone is welcome to contribute to this project, as long as the "vision" for this project is maintained. 
By that I mean that the program needs to meet the descriptive requirements for the "look and feel" that I 
have described in the "PgDesign Description" and the "PgDesign Notes" documents.  Both of these documents 
will be updated from time to time.  The project will be developed using the latest version of QtCreator 
("Community" version) as the programming tool.
This project will be licensed under the GPL version 3 or later.
The purpose of this project is to be a blessing to mankind.  PgDesign is designed to be a practical "replacement" for 
MS Access, that only requires open source components.  The goal is to someday surpass the current version of MS Access
in quality, reliability, ease of use, flexibility, and advanced technology. In my opinion, when this objective is 
acheived, there will no longer be any logical reason for any person to keep using the Windows operating system.
